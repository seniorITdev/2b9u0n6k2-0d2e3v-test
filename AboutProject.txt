This project focuses on fair expense distribution among a group of travelers through a backend script. The central logic is executed by the `mapPayouts` function, which calculates individual expenses, average contributions, and debts among travelers. This function then sorts travelers by their balances and computes payouts, pairing those who owe with those who are owed until all debts are settled. The `PayoutService` class handles HTTP requests, extracting expenses, computing payouts, and responding with results or error messages. Additionally, the project employs an `isEqual` function to compare numbers while accounting for precision issues in floating-point arithmetic.
